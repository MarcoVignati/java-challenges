# 01 - FizzBuzz

#### Description:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

#### Resolution:

This solution was quite simple. At first, I thought I would have to use an ArrayList, but I quickly found out that I could resolve everything with 'for' and 'if' statements. I placed the verification of multiples of 3 and 5 first, and then placed the individual verifications in an 'else' statement to avoid repetition of numbers.
